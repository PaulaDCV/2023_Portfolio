# Investigating IMDB movie returns
This project looked at the IMDB dataset, and aimed to understand what features in a movie make good returns.
## The Dataset:
The dataset used is the IMDB dataset, it consists of a list of films with information about each one of them, 
from technical details, such as their director, budget, year it was released etc, to other details such as facebook likes of the directors and actors.
## Project overview:
1. Cleaning and Feature engineering:
    A new column was created to calculate the returns given by the movies. Removal of duplicates rows,
    being careful to not remove remakes with the same title.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis  
    The first step was looking at the dataset, to get an idea of the number of features, missing values, any issues. 
    There was an initial analysis looking at some correlations between values.
